 Initialize Helprox with your iOS API key and App ID.  This will allow your app to connect with Helprox.

 If you call registerUnidentifiedUser, all activity will be tracked anonymously. If you choose to subsequently
 identify that user, all that anonymous activity will be merged into the identified user. This means that you
 will no longer see the anonymous user in Helprox, but rather the identified one.
 
 We recommend this is called from within the application delegate's didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method.
 
 @note You must call one of the user registration methods in order to start communicating with Helprox.

 In order to keep track of a specific user, you must identify it with a unique user identifier, an email
 address, or both. By supplying information like this Helprox provides richer user profiles for your users.
 This is a userId, supplied by you (e.g. from an existing web service for your product) to represent your
 user in Helprox, once set it cannot be changed.
 
 If you are putting Helprox for iOS into an app that has persisted an authentication token or equivalent
 so your users don't have to log in repeatedly (like most apps) then we advise putting the user registration
 call in the `didBecomeActive:` method in your application delegate. This won't have any negative impact if
 you also add it to your authentication success method elsewhere in your app.
 
 @param userId  A unique identifier for your user.
 @param email   Your user's email address.
 @note You must call one of the user registration methods in order to start communicating with Helprox.

 reset is used to reset all local caches and user data Helprox has created. Reset will also close any active
 UI that is on screen. Use this at a time when you wish to log a user out of your app or change a user.
 Once called, Helprox for iOS will no longer communicate with Helprox until a further registration is made.

 Set the device token for push notifications. Once the device token is set, the methods for receiving push
 notifications are safely swizzled so ones sent from Helprox can be intercepted. When a push notification from
 Helprox is received, Helprox for iOS will automatically launch the message from the notification.

 Use this method to check if a push notification payload was sent by Helprox. Typically you should call

 @return YES if the payload is an Helprox push notification, NO otherwise.

//=========================================================================================================
/*!
 These are notifications thrown by Helprox for iOS when the Helprox window is displayed and hidden or when
 a new conversation has been started. These notifications are fired only when there is a change in the state
 of Helprox's UI: when a user receives a message for instance, willShow and didShow notifications will be
 fired accordingly when the Helprox Notification (chat head) is presented.
 
 Once the user taps on the chat head, the message is presented in your app. It will be presented covering
 the entire screen, but no notifications will be thrown here as Helprox has already been visible.
 
 In the case of a new conversation this notification may be used to prompt users to enable push notifications.
